"""Find all lists that a member's address is on.

Usage:
    find_member [options] regex [regex [...]]

Where:
    --listname=listname
    -l listname
        Include only the named list in the search.

    --exclude=listname
    -x listname
        Exclude the named list from the search.

    --owners
    -w
        Search list owners as well as members.

    --help
    -h
        Print this help message and exit.

    regex
        A Python regular expression to match against.

The interaction between -l and -x is as follows.  If any -l option is given
then only the named list will be included in the search.  If any -x option is
given but no -l option is given, then all lists will be search except those
specifically excluded.

Regular expression syntax is Perl5-like, using the Python re module.  Complete
specifications are at:

https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html

Address matches are case-insensitive, but case-preserved addresses are
displayed.
