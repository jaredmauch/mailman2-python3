# 2 - Leave it inline, but HTML-escape it
# 3 - Remove text/html as attachments but don't HTML-escape them. Note: this

# These variables control the format and frequency of VERP-like delivery for
# better bounce detection.  VERP is Variable Envelope Return Path, defined
# here:
#
# http://cr.yp.to/proto/verp.txt
#
# This involves encoding the address of the recipient as we (Mailman) know it
# into the envelope sender address (i.e. the SMTP `MAIL FROM:' address).
# Thus, no matter what kind of forwarding the recipient has in place, should
# it eventually bounce, we will receive an unambiguous notice of the bouncing
# address.
#
# However, we're technically only "VERP-like" because we're doing the envelope
# sender encoding in Mailman, not in the MTA.  We do require cooperation from
# the MTA, so you must be sure your MTA can be configured for extended address
# semantics.
#
# The first variable describes how to encode VERP envelopes.  It must contain
# these three string interpolations:
#
# %(bounces)s -- the list-bounces mailbox will be set here
# %(mailbox)s -- the recipient's mailbox will be set here
# %(host)s    -- the recipient's host name will be set here
#
# This example uses the default below.
#
# FQDN list address is: mylist@dom.ain
# Recipient is:         aperson@a.nother.dom
#
# The envelope sender will be mylist-bounces+aperson=a.nother.dom@dom.ain
#
# Note that your MTA /must/ be configured to deliver such an addressed message
# to mylist-bounces!
VERP_FORMAT = '%(bounces)s+%(mailbox)s=%(host)s'

# The second describes a regular expression to unambiguously decode such an
# address, which will be placed in the To: header of the bounce message by the
# bouncing MTA.  Getting this right is critical -- and tricky.  Learn your
# Python regular expressions.  It must define exactly three named groups,
# bounces, mailbox and host, with the same definition as above.  It will be
# compiled case-insensitively.

VERP_PROBES = No

# A perfect opportunity for doing VERP is the password reminders, which are
# already addressed individually to each recipient.  Set this to Yes to enable
# VERPs on all password reminders.  However, because password reminders are
# sent from the site list and site list bounces aren't processed but are just
# forwarded to the site list admins, this isn't too useful.  See comments at
# lines 70-84 of Mailman/Queue/BounceRunner.py for why we don't process them.

# Another good opportunity is when regular delivery is personalized.  Here

# regular deliveries (personalized digests aren't supported yet).
VERP_PERSONALIZED_DELIVERIES = No

# And finally, we can VERP normal, non-personalized deliveries.  However,
# because it can be a significant performance hit, we allow you to decide how
# often to VERP regular deliveries.  This is the interval, in number of
# messages, to do a VERP recipient address.  The same variable controls both

#
# %(addr)s -- the list-confirm mailbox will be set here
