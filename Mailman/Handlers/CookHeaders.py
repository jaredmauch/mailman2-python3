    #    in any fields in From: are indicative of spamminess.  This means
    #    it should be in Reply-To: or Cc:.
    # 3) the behavior of an MUA doing a 'reply' or 'reply all' should be
    #    consistent regardless of whether or not the From: is munged.
    # Goal 3) implies sometimes the original From: should be in Reply-To:
