"""Do more detailed spam detection.

This module hard codes site wide spam detection.  By hacking the
KNOWN_SPAMMERS variable, you can set up more regular expression matches
against message headers.  If spam is detected the message is discarded
immediately.

TBD: This needs to be made more configurable and robust.
